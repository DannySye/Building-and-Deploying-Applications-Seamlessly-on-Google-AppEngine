About This Project
This repository is designed to be a "true" project resource. It's more than just code; it includes:

Clear Documentation: Step-by-step instructions to ensure you can run the demos yourself.

Two Deployment Strategies: Code for both the Standard and Flexible environments, allowing you to compare the two directly.

Best Practices: Includes a .gitignore file and a structured layout, just like a real-world project.

The Application: A Number Guessing Game
To make the demonstration engaging, the application is a simple and interactive number guessing game built with Python and Flask. The game:

Generates a random number between 1 and 100.

Prompts the user to guess the number.

Provides feedback ("Too high" or "Too low").

Congratulates the user upon a correct guess and shows the number of attempts.

This simple application is perfect for demonstrating core deployment concepts without getting bogged down in complex code.

Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to deploy the application to your own Google Cloud project.

Part 1: Initial Cloud Setup (Do this once)
Before deploying, you need to configure your Google Cloud environment.

Create a Project: Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.

Enable Billing: Ensure billing is enabled for your project. The App Engine free tier is generous, but billing is required.

Enable APIs: In the Cloud Console, search for and enable the App Engine Admin API and Cloud Build API.

Install Google Cloud CLI: Install the Google Cloud CLI on your local machine.

Initialize the CLI: Open your terminal and run gcloud init. Follow the prompts to log in, select the project you just created, and choose a default region for App Engine when prompted.

Part 2: Demo 1 - Deploying to the Standard Environment
The Standard environment is ideal for rapid development and applications that can benefit from scaling to zero.

Navigate to the correct directory:

cd standard-environment-demo

Deploy the application:
Run the deployment command. Google Cloud will automatically detect the app.yaml file, package your code, and deploy it.

gcloud app deploy

Confirm and Wait: You will be prompted to confirm the deployment. Type Y and press Enter. The process should take a few minutes.

View your live application:
Once the deployment is complete, run the following command to open the application in your web browser:

gcloud app browse

Part 3: Demo 2 - Deploying to the Flexible Environment
The Flexible environment uses Docker containers, giving you more control over the runtime and system dependencies.

Navigate to the correct directory:
From the root of the project, navigate to the flexible-environment-demo folder.

cd ../flexible-environment-demo

Deploy the application:
The command is the same. Cloud Build will now use the Dockerfile to build a container image before deploying it.

gcloud app deploy

Confirm and Wait: This deployment will take longer than the standard environment because it has to build the Docker container and provision the underlying virtual machine resources.

View your live application:
Once complete, run the same command to see your live application:

gcloud app browse

You have now successfully deployed the same application to two different App Engine environments!
